# AES file archiver

Small custom project to get a ZIP archive file encrypted by AES-256-CBC, that use AES Crypt (https://www.aescrypt.com) lib. Final zip-file is still compatible with this lib.

Some resources from Oracle JRE are included "as-it" (JCE files), i'm not affiliated with Oracle some use files from official Oracle site, according to their policy and your country laws.

Two scripts are given as examples for a typical usage in windows. They required "admin" privilege only to check JCE files.
